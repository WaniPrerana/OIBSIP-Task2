                <h2>Prerana Wani </h2>
                <P class="about">Hi there! My name is Prerana wani, and I am a Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering
                    student at R. C. Patel Institute of Technology , Shirpur. Which is an autonomous institute.
                    I have a passion for front-end development, which
                    involves creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces for web applications.

                    I take pride in my ability to create designs that are both beautiful and functional, and I am
                    skilled in using a variety of programming languages, tools, and techniques to achieve this. Whether
                    I am working on a personal project or collaborating with others, I always strive to create designs
                    that are easy to use, intuitive, and visually engaging.

                    As a developer, I am committed to learning and growing in my field. I am constantly seeking out new
                    opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills, whether through coursework, personal projects, or
                    participation in tech communities. My goal is to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and
                    technologies in web development so that I can continue to create innovative and cutting-edge
                    applications.

                    One of my core values as a developer is accessibility. I believe that technology should be inclusive
                    and accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or background. That's why I take great
                    care to build applications that are accessible to a wide range of users, using best practices for
                    accessibility and exploring new technologies and approaches to web development.

                    In the future, I hope to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in the tech
                    community. Whether I am working on a personal project or collaborating with others, I am dedicated
                    to creating innovative and accessible web applications that can benefit society as a whole.

                    Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit more about me. If you have any questions or would like
                    to collaborate on a project, please don't hesitate to reach out.</P>

                <p>
                    As a web designer, I had created 'Instgram app clone' with using HTML and CSS , which includes
                    creating a posting page where users can scroll and see the posted images. Majorly I had 
                    divided it into three sections as header section, page contect section and footer section .

                <p>
                    Recently I have done my new project which is of ' Landing page'. Its a standlone web page that
                    a person "land " on after clicking through from an email , ad, or other digital location. 
                    Every content strategy should include the use of landing pages to convert more traffic 
                    and increase conversions.
